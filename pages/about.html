                I previously worked in IT and have a Bachelor of Science degree in it. It's from 2005
                - the tech does change fast. (When the internet became a thing in the 90s I
                bought a 1200 baud dialup modem.)
                I have been practicing, and I am enrolled in a bootcamp to upskill
                my web chops and learn React.

                I have been playing the piano since I was six years old, and it is
                still my favorite thing. Before I decided on a tech degree, I attended music
                school for a few years. By then I had a 56 kilobaud modem!

                I am a fan of animals and live with three dogs, several cats, and
                one human. Two dogs are new 6-month-old border collie mutts from
                Lexington, KY. (Now there is a fiber modem. It is not dialup.)
