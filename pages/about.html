              I previously worked in IT and have a degree in it. It's from 2005
              - the tech has changed. (When the internet went public in the 90s I
              bought a 1200kBd dialup modem.)
              I have been practicing, and I am enrolled in a bootcamp to upskill
              my web chops and learn React.
