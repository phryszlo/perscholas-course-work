### The main repo for my PerScholas software engineering course work.

At this point the repo is following assignment requirements to the best of my understanding,
but the content is not yet intended as, say, text for my actual portfolio. I am concentrating on form more than content.

> **Pre-work: things I have been working on**
> - Basic responsive design
>   - Overflow and scroll of only the table section (#interests-section) in Bio page (still called about.html)
>   - Fluid text resizing using clamp() function. Got idea and technique from [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/modern-fluid-typography-css-clamp/) and [here](https://css-tricks.com/simplified-fluid-typography/) 
> - I have concerns about accessibility, because zoom is not working on my table text, but I might not get to that problem yet as it is outside the scope of the assignment.
> - The form responsiveness has not been addressed yet, see above point.

### NOTES:  

- It is simple to rename a repo, but when I did, somehow the links in the nav reverted to
the bio.html name.
