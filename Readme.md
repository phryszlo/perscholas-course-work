The main repo for my PerScholas software engineering course work.

At this point the repo is following assignment requirements to the best of my understanding,
but the content is in no way intended as, say, text for my actual portfolio.

At this point I am more concerned with the technical details and methods of design.

The good news is it is simple to rename a repo, but when I did, somehow the links in the nav reverted to
the bio.html name.
